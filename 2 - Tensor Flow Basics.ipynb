    "\n",
    "The biggest idea about Tensorflow is that all the numerical computations are expressed as a computational graph. In other words, the backbone of any Tensorflow program is a Graph. Anything that happens in your model is represented by the computational graph. This makes it, the to go place for anything related to your model. Quoted from the TensorFlow website, \"A computational graph (or graph in short) is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes\". Basically, it means a graph is just an arrangement of nodes that represent the operations in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So First let's see what does a node and operation mean? The best way to explain it is by looking at a simple example. Suppose we want to write the code for function $f(x,y)=x^2y+y+2$. The Graph in TensorFlow will be something like:![SimpleGraph](simple_graph.png \"SimpleGraph\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is composed of a series of nodes connected to each other by edges (from the image above). Each node in the graph is called op (short for operation). So we'll have one node for each operation; either for operations on tensors (like math operations) or generating tensors (like variables and constants). Each node takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces a tensor as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now Let's build a simple computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Let's start with a basic arithmatic operation like addition to demonstrate a graph. The code adds two values, say a=2 and b=3, using TensorFlow. To do so, we need to call tf.add(). From here on, we recommend you to check out the documentation of each method/class to get a clear idea of what it can do(documentation can be found at tensorflow.org or you can just use google to get to the required page in the documentation). The tf.add() has three arugments 'x', 'y', and 'name' where x and y are the values to be added together and name is the operation name, i.e. the name associated to the addition node on the graph.\n",

When we print out the variable c (i.e. the output Tensor of the addition operation), it prints out the Tensor information; its name (Add), shape (() means scalar), and type (32-bit integer). However, It does not spit out the result (2+3=5). Why?!\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember earlier in this post, we talked about the two parts of a TensorFlow code. First step is to create a graph and to actually evaluate the nodes, we must run the computational graph within a Session. In simple words, the written code only generates the graph which only determines the expected sizes of Tensors and operations to be executed on them. However, it doesn't assign a numeric value to any of the Tensors i.e. TensorFlow does not execute the graph unless it is specified to do so with a session. Hence, to assign these values and make them flow through the graph, we need to create and run a session.\n",

In fact, we can build the graph without any data. Therefore, placeholders don't need any initial value; only a datatype (such as float32) and a tensor shape so the graph still knows what to compute with even though it doesn't have any stored values yet.\n",

You might have guessed it, its simply because the placeholder is empty and there is no way to add an empty tensor to a constant tensor in the add operation. To solve this, we need to feed an input value to the tensor \"b\". It can be done by creating a dictionary (\"d\" in the following code) whose key(s) are the placeholders and their values are the desired value to be passed to the placeholder(s), and feeding it to an argument called \"feed_dict\". In our example, say we want to pass $[1, 2, 3]$ to the placeholder; the code needs to be modified as:"
